The solution lies in understanding and adjusting CSS specificity.  To ensure the `font-size: 14px` rule applies to paragraphs within the `.container`, we need to make it more specific than the inherited `font-size: 16px`. The solution includes clarifying inheritance and specificity issues:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 14px; /* Now correctly overrides inherited font-size */
}

p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

.container span {
  font-size: 18px;
  color: green; /* This style will override the parent p color */
}
```
By directly setting `font-size: 14px` on `.container p`, we give it higher specificity than the inherited style, resolving the unexpected behavior.
